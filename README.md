# LipReLU
This repositories is the code for paper "Enhancing Node-Level Adversarial Defenses by Lipschitz Regularization of Graph Neural Networks" in Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. In addition, restricted to the paper limit of KDD2023, some experimental results can't be placed in the paper, we place them here.

In the following, we give some major experimental codes and explain their function:
